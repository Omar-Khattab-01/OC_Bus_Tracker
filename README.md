short_description: Chat-style OC Transpo block to bus location tracker
---

OC Bus Tracker is a chat-style web app for quickly checking live OC Transpo bus locations from a block number (for example `44-07`).

Type a block number in the chat and the app returns active buses plus location text pulled from BetterTransit + TransSee.
